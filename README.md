About refreshing AASA file on apple CDN:
https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/699401

The system will check approximately once a week for an updated AASA. Other sources tell - ones a day.  
If you trigger a sysdiagnose, in the swcutil_show.txt file you can look for your domain and find information about when the "last check" was, and when the next check will be.  
If you are iterating at a fast pace, you can use developer mode, and directly pull the AASA from your web server.  
To trigger a download you still need to delete the app and reinstall via Xcode (TF and App Store do not work for developer mode.)  

Developer mode example: `applinks:mydomain.com?mode=developer` in entitlements. Xcode -> Signing and.. -> Associated Domains.

Make sure you enable Associated Domains Development on Developer menu in iOS Settings.

In macOS 11 and later and iOS 14 and later, apps request apple-app-site-association files from an Apple-managed content delivery network (CDN) specifically for associated domains, instead of directly from your web server. If the CDN has an old version of the file, or doesnâ€™t already have a copy of the file, it connects to your web server to obtain the latest version.
